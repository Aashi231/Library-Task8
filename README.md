# Library-Task8

Project Title: Library Management System - Stored Procedures and Functions

Task Objective:
This task demonstrates the creation of reusable SQL blocks using stored procedures and functions in a relational database for the Library Managemnet System.

What I Did:
a)Created a stored procedure (GetMemberLoans) to list all loan records for a specific member using a parameterized input.
b)Created a function (CountBookLoans) to count the number of times a particular book has been loaned, returning an integer.
c)Included examples of how to call and use both the stored procedure and the function.
d)Tested and validated the logic using MySQL Workbench.

Key SQL Features Used:
- CREATE PROCEDURE
- CREATE FUNCTION
- Parameterized logic
- Reusable code blocks
- Conditional declarations

Tools Used:
- MySQL Workbench

  Outcome:
  This task built confidence in using procedural SQL programming to modularize repeated database logic, making future queries and reporting more maintainable and efficient.
